/**
 * One row of the Parameters window — one parameter, as everything that draws or edits one reads it.
 *
 * <p><b>What a row comes from is the bot's own Java.</b> A parameter is a {@code @Param} static field the
 * host reads off the syntax tree, and the section it is listed under is the class that declares it. A
 * plugin that wants a row of its own puts a {@code @Param} field in the file it ships, and the same walk
 * finds it — which is why no contribution surface in this package remains.
 *
 * <h2>Every component is already contract vocabulary</h2>
 *
 * <p>A name, the declared type <em>as the field writes it</em>, the value's Java source, a
 * {@link Visibility}, a declared option set, two numeric bounds, and a free-text category. Nothing
 * plugin-specific crosses and nothing here is a {@link Class} the host would have to load.
 *
 * <p><b>The type is the written name, not a tree</b> (2026-09-22). It carried a {@code ValueForm} until the
 * grammar became the host's — a {@code Map<String, List<Duration>>} is a structure only the thing that
 * writes and reads the Java needs to walk, and nothing outside the host ever walked one. What a row's
 * consumers actually use is the spelling: to label the row, to compare two rows, and to find the type's
 * editor. That is {@link #typeName()}.
 *
 * <h2>The value is one source string, because a composite has no other canonical form</h2>
 *
 * <p>It was a {@code List<String>} of wires until 2026-09-20 — one entry for an ordinary row, one per item
 * for a list-shaped one — and that list was only ever there to carry the <em>list</em> shape. It could not
 * encode {@code Map<String, List<Duration>>}, which a bot may perfectly well declare, so the value crosses
 * as <b>the Java initialiser the field takes</b>. {@code 32-generic-values.md} decision 6.
 *
 * <p>That is not a wire encoding in a different spelling. A wire existed so a <em>bot</em> could read a
 * value with the contract jar absent; nothing at runtime reads a value once the model is compiled code. The
 * source is the artifact, and a value's canonical form is the source that produces it.
 *
 * <h2>Built, never constructed</h2>
 *
 * <p>A plugin may <b>build</b> a row, so this is a final class with a builder: a record's canonical
 * constructor is part of its binary signature, and a component added later would throw
 * {@code NoSuchMethodError} in every plugin already compiled against it. Compatibility trap #2 in
 * {@code docs/refactor/25-compatibility.md}.
 *
 * <h2>No section here, deliberately</h2>
 *
 * <p>A row does not carry the class it was read out of. Nothing that holds a row holds it alone — the host
 * pairs it with the field it came from, which knows the file, the class and whether the value may be
 * rewritten — so a section component here could only ever repeat that or contradict it.
